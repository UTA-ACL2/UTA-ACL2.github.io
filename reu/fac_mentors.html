            <p>Vassilis Athitsos is a professor of computer science and engineering at UTA. A significant part of his research effort focuses on human motion analysis and gesture recognition. In recent projects, he and his team have developed and published new methods for sign language recognition and automatic scoring of physical exercises performed by children. While at UTA, he has mentored 14 undergraduates in their research. Several of those undergraduates belonged to groups that are underrepresented in computer science: four were women (one of which is also Deaf and African American), two were Hispanics, and one had an Asian/Pacific ethnic background. Several of these students have authored or coauthored research papers. One of these undergraduates later graduated with a Computer Science Master from Carnegie Mellon. At least four of those students are currently Ph.D. students, including one recently joining the Computer Science Ph.D. program at the University of Chicago.  </p>
