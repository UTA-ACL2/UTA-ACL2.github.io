            <p>Phase 1 is <b>part-time</b> only. You are expected to spend up to 5 hours a week on the project. We expect you to acquire the necessary knowledge about animal behaviors and communications as well as some necessary computing skills before you
come to the full-time summer program in Phase 2. We also expect you to collect some animal communication videos and annotate them if possible that will facilitate further 
research in Phase 2.

            <p>
            Phase 2 of this REU site program is a full-time position designed to fully immerse you in a graduate-level research experience. As such, we require all participants to have the REU as their sole summer commitment during those 10 weeks. 
The REU offers a $6000 stipend, free housing, and a meal plan to assist 
with financial obligations.

            Do I have to live on UTA campus?

            <div class='content'>
            <p>
            A very strong element of an REU experience are the many extracurricular activities that you and your REU cohort of 10 students can take part in. We do require that all REU participants live on UTA campus during the summer. The dorm is available starting May 23rd and will be available for the REU students
during the program. The REU Housing will be at UTA's <a href='https://www.uta.edu/campus-ops/housing/reshalls/west-hall'>West Hall.</a>

            What are you looking for in an REU applicant?
            </div>
            <div class='content'>
            <p>
            We are looking for undergraduate researchers that have a "maker spirit"  i.e., students that demonstrate that they enjoy to pursue independent projects, pick up new skills outside of their school work, and share their work with others.
            </p>
            <p>
            The REU is designed to be interdisciplinary. We will be recruiting a balance of skills within your cohort of 10 students so that you can mutually benefit from interacting with others to solve problems that may be outside your personal knowledge base.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a common base, we would like REU participants to have some background in Computer Science, ideally taking courses in Data Structures or Object-Oriented Programming. We want participants to feel comfortable reading, writing, and debugging code; you will likely need to pick up a new programming language for many of the projects.
            </p>
            <p>
            No prior research experience is required, but it does help us to see independent projects that demonstrate some of your critical thinking skills.
            </p>
            <p>
            You should have some interest in pursuing a graduate degree. If your plan is to directly enter and stay in industry, the REU may not be the best road for you. If you are still exploring what pursuing a graduate degree, especially a Ph.D., would entail, you are in the right spot.
            </p>
            <p>
            We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive REU experience. We are looking to recruit students from all backgrounds whether this be: gender, ethnicity, discipline, sexual orientation, or students with disabilities. We welcome students from community colleges or primarily undergraduate institutions (i.e., those that don't have graduate programs).

                What should I write in a Personal Statement?
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>A SOP for applying this project should consist of two parts. The first part should be the MOTIVATION, please describe why you would like to participate in this project and what you want to achieve in this project? </p>
                <p>The second part should be the proposal for the Phase 1. In Phase 1, you are expected to collect high quality animal video data which should contain consecutive and meaningful audio segments as well as your personal speculation about the content of that audio segment. The proposal should include the relevant plans you have made for this, including the types of animals, methods of capturing sound, total duration of captured videos, equipment used for filming, and other relevant aspects. The project admission leans towards a detailed and comprehensive proposal.</p>
