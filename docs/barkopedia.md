## üì£ Updates

**2025-04-15**  
- Competition officially launches; training data is released.

## üìä Overview

Dogs use vocalizations to communicate intentions, emotions, and contextual cues. While prior research shows that machine learning models can classify dog barks based on context, individual identity, and emotion, existing studies often suffer from limited scale, generalizability, or robustness due to small datasets or handcrafted features.

This challenge, hosted at [IJCAI 2025](https://2025.ijcai.org/), addresses these issues by providing a large-scale, diverse benchmark dataset of real-world dog vocalizations sourced from YouTube and Reddit. The competition includes eight tasks designed to promote research at the intersection of machine learning, audio/speech processing, and animal communication.

The competition results, dataset, leaderboard, and result submissions are all hosted on Hugging Face. So if you don‚Äôt have a Hugging Face account yet, please register for one. Then sign up here to participate and stay informed: [Registration Form](https://forms.office.com/r/0ZmFjYnW2p)

## üìù Tasks

The competition includes eight tasks. The first six involve classifying dog vocalization by categories such as individual, breed, sex, age, environment, etc. The last two tasks focuses on audio denoising to extract clean dog barks from noisy recordings (either as a sound source separation or sound event
detection task). All tasks are open simultaneously.

- **Task 1 (‚úÖ Open):** Dog Age Group Classification
